## Introduction

Wheat is one of the most important crops globally, serving as a staple food for millions. However, farmers face numerous challenges, including pests, diseases, and climate variability. This project utilizes AI to address these issues, providing tools for data analysis, image classification, and object detection.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze various data points to understand trends and patterns in wheat farming.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data for better decision-making.
- **Deep Learning**: Implement deep learning models to enhance image classification.
- **Object Detection**: Detect and classify objects in images, such as pests and diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for farmers and researchers.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for model building.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for image analysis.
- **Web Frameworks**: Flask for building the web application.
