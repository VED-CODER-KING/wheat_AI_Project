# 🌾 Smart Wheat Farming AI System

## 📝 Overview
This project, **Smart Wheat Farming AI System**, was developed by AI students at **Esprit School of Engineering** as part of an academic project.  
It leverages artificial intelligence to tackle key agricultural challenges related to wheat farming in Tunisia.  
The work is divided into six main axes:
- Disease Detection (Classification & Detection)
- Pest Detection
- Weed Detection
- Production Quality Assessment
- Plant Growth Monitoring
- Soil Quality Analysis

This project is hosted on GitHub using **GitHub Education tools** and aims to support sustainable agriculture through intelligent technologies.

## ⚙️ Features
- Deep learning models for plant disease classification and detection.
- Object detection models for pests and weeds.
- Computer vision-based growth stage monitoring.
- Quality assessment metrics for wheat production.
- Soil data analysis using machine learning.
- Modular and scalable design for future agricultural extensions.

### 🖥️ Frontend
- React.js 
- HTML5 / CSS 

### 💻 Backend
- Python (main AI logic)
- FastAPI or Flask (for serving models as APIs)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation and prototyping)

### 🛠️ Other Tools
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for AI model training)
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing and analysis)
- Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)
- GitHub Education (free hosting, tools like Heroku, Namecheap)
- Google Colab (for training experiments)
- LabelImg / Roboflow (for dataset labeling)
